#** README Tamandu√° - CMS **#

###** Requirements **###
 * PHP 5.3+
 * php-composer

###** Framework **###
Symfony2 - version 2.2.0

[Symfony Site](http://symfony.com/])

###** External Bundles **###
 * [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle)

###** Internal Bundles **###
 1. Acme (symfony2 default demo bundle)

 2. CMS

  - StoreBundle: Bundle of all the database models and Back-end Admin controllers.
  - AdminBundle: Bundle of Front-end CMS Admin controllers.
  - SiteBundle: Dummy bundle of a joint of views and controllers, to make the front-end WebSite.

###** Production bundle structure **###
 1. StoreBundle

  - Databases and Controllers of the back-end admin, this should be in a different server, to avoid copies and hacking.

 2. AdminBundle

  - Controllers of the front-end admin, this one **NEED** to be on the same server of the application.

 3. SiteBundle

  - Can have more than one site bundle, and they don't need to have the name "SiteBundle", this one can be hosted in any server.

###** The Idea **###
An powered CMS with the core no-hosted on the client, with a administrator area that you can administer how many sites as you want.
